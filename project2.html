          >My Name is Crystal Nkemeh. Technology is a passion of mine and I
          enjoy nothing more than learning the trends that technology is taking
          in order to work more efficiently and see progress and success. I love
          seeing the big picture mapped out for technology needs. I love how it
          has the ability to impact lives at a level and scale that has never
          been realized in the history of mankind.

          Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) makes the front-end of a website shine and
          it creates a great user experience. Without CSS, websites would be
          less pleasing to the eye and likely much harder to navigate. In
          addition to layout and format, CSS is responsible for font color and
          more. I have learnt how to link CSS sheet to the html and different
          ways of styling (in-line,external and internal) and differnet things
          you can style.
